Install Flask and any necessary dependencies
Set up a Flask app instance
Define the routes for the different CRUD operations (e.g. create, read, update, delete)
Define the necessary functions for each route (e.g. to create a new record, retrieve records, update records, or delete records from a database)
Set up templates to display the data from the database on the frontend
Configure the app's database connection and schema
Run, test, debug

Create your own basic CRUD flask app using Jinja templates and SQLite with SQLalchemy from scratch:
The database should just use one table and model (Users) which will have the users name and email.
A main page that shows the user's names and emails in a list and has buttons that delete users from the database.
A create page in which you can create new users in the database.
An update page in which you can edit users in the database.
Do not directly copy and change a tutorial for this (although you can do a tutorial that is similar first then try to build this yourself). The idea is to get you used to googling and reading documentation to figure out how to solve problems.
Feel free to ask for help in the server while doing this if you are not able to find the answer from googling.
